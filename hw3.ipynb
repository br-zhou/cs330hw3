    "| Feature | Transformation | Explanation\n",
    "| --- | ----------- | ----- |\n",
    "| age | scaling with `StandardScaler` |  A numeric feature with no missing values, ranging from 17 to 90. Scaling is recommended due to its distinct range compared to other numeric features. While MinMaxScaler might be more suitable, using StandardScaler should be fine too.|\n",
    "| workclass | imputation, one-hot encoding | Since workclass is a non-numeric set of strings, it makes sense to use one-hot encoding to represent each job class, since ordinal enncoding could affect the learning process by creating artificial trends that do not actually exist. Additionally, roughly 1,000 datapoints are null, which means dropping the null values would drastically impact our dataset. The best solution is to replace the null points with 'private' value, since it already represents a majority of the datapoints (70%).  |\n",
    "| fnlwgt | drop | This column represents the probability that an individual is likely to be interviewed, which isn't relevant to our prediction model.  |\n",
    "| education | ordinal encoding | Since education is stored as string categories, it needs to be encoded. Should be stored as ordinal encoding since education is mostly linear. (eg. Highschool < Bachelors < Masters < PHD) |\n",
    "| education.num | drop | Education is already ordinally encoded for us through this column. Presuably we are dropping it in favor our newly transformed education column to practice ordinal encoding ourselves. |\n",
    "| marital.status | one-hot encoding  | Currently a set of string categories, which needs to be encoded. Oridinal doesn't work because there isn't linear correlation between all the categories that would help the model. |\n",
    "| occupation | imputation, one-hot encoding  | (Same reasoning as work class) Since occupation is a non-numeric set of strings, it makes sense to use one-hot encoding to represent each job class, since ordinal enncoding could affect the learning process by creating artificial trends that do not actually exist. Additionally, roughly 1,000 datapoints are null, which means dropping the null values would drastically impact our dataset. The best solution is to replace the null points with 'private' value, since it already represents a majority of the datapoints (70%). |\n",
    "| relationship | one-hot encoding  | (Same reason as marital.status) Currently a set of string categories, which needs to be encoded. Oridinal doesn't work because there isn't linear correlation between all the categories that would help the model. |\n",
    "| race | drop  | Since whites make up roughly 85% of the dataset, keeping race may cause the machine learning dataset to learn racist generializtions on minorities because it doesn't have enough data (ethics). |\n",
    "| sex | one-hot encoding with \"binary=True\" | OHE over Ordinality because ordinality can imply a sequence to the model (eg. men > women), which can affect performance by messing with weight. We want to use Binary=TRUE to avoid redundant columns. |\n",
    "| capital.gain | scaling with `StandardScaler` | A numeric feature with no missing values. Should be scaled to prevent magnitude bias. Standard scaler is better than min max scaler because the distrubtion is not even, as seen with the mean being 1% of the max value. This could destroy the models sensitvity, since most values get crushed together. | \n",
    "| capital.loss | scaling with `StandardScaler` | (Same as captical.gain) A numeric feature with no missing values. Should be scaled to prevent magnitude bias. Standard scaler is better than min max scaler because the distrubtion is not even, as seen with the mean being ~10% of the max value. This could destroy the models sensitvity, since most values get crushed together. |\n",
    "| hours.per.week | scaling with `StandardScaler` | A numeric feature with no missing values. Should be scaled to prevent magnitude bias. Standard scaler is better than min max scaler because the distrubtion is not even, as seen with the mean being 50% of the max value. This might affect the models sensitvity, since most values get crushed together. Although, MinMaxScaler could probably be used here. |\n",
    "| native.country | imputation, one-hot encoding | Since values are a set of strings, needs to be encoded. Has to be OHE over Oridinal because oridinal implies a sequence which may create artificial trends. Impudatation is needed because some values are null. Null values could probably be dropped since less than 2% of the data points are missing. However, this missing data could also hold valuable minority data, so creating a new \"unknown\" value can help prevent bias towards overrepresented counties, potentially making the AI better. | \n",

    "**Question 1:**\n",
    "If I call fit_transform on my test data, I recalculate the mean and the standard deviation based on the test. However, I only want to call fit on the training data, since fitting on the test data gives the model information of the data data points, which it shouldn't have. This breaks the golden rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2:** It is important to follow the Golden rule to maximize the accuracy of our test scores. Although violating the golen rule wont necessarily make your classifier worse (since you're training on more data), it usually artifically boosts the accuracy of your model, leading to inconsistent deployment statistics and a much worse classifier than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3:** There are multiple advantages of using pipelines. Pipelines help us elegantly perform transformations, keeping our code clean and reproducable. Addtionally, pipelines help us avoid mistakes like data leakage (breaking the golden rule). We can pass our pipeline directly into `cross_validate` and `cross_val_score`to easily run cross validation without data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4:** We want to use column transformer when we want to run multiple preprocessing steps, usually because our features require different preprocessing techniques. `2.1 Identify transformations to apply` is a great example of why column transformers are helpful for real world datasets.\n"

Store it in a variable called `best_C`. (Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the highest CV score.)
